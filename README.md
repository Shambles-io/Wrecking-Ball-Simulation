# Wrecking-Ball-Simulation

This is a very simple wrecking ball simulation "game."

The user can create and "fire" a wrecking ball by pressing on the screen

When the player (left) clicks within the game window a red will appear at that point. When the player clicks again the ball is released (falls to the bottom/ground). When the player clicks again the previous ball will be deleted and a new ball appears at the point on click.

The player can control the balls initial trajectory and velocity by moving their cursor after creating the ball. A black line will indicate the direction and magnitude of force when it "fires."

The log "house" can be broken down and the hanging wrecking ball can be collided with.
